# Improved Maps [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

**This mod is a work in progress!**

This mod is only for Fabric Servers(or Single-Player) and requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api). Works with Vanilla clients!

### Current Features
- **Atlas** - A combination between a bundle and a map. 
  - Fill it with empty maps and it will automatically create new maps as you explore off the edge of your current map. 
  - Automatically switch to the relevant map when returning to previous areas.
  - Make a copy of the entire Atlas. Great for map walls!
- **Map Information Tooltips** - See the map scale and center coordinates right from the tooltip

### Planned/Missing Features
- Keep more than 64 filled maps in your Atlas
- Cartography table interactions
- Optional client-side features like a mini-map and world map

### Shout-outs
- [Map Atlases](https://modrinth.com/mod/map-atlases) by Pepperoni-Jabroni for the original idea and map switching logic.
